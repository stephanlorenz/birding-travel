We strongly favor sustainable ecotourism and will highlight working examples in\r\nour pages whenever possible. As birders and travellers we can play an integral role in conserving habitats and\r\nprotecting birds around the globe.  \r\n\r\nArticles will include a wide range of topics, but mainly revolve around birding travel experiences from afar and North\r\nAmerica. From basic site guides, personal travel essays, to species sketches, Birding Travel looks at birding\r\nopportunities through the eyes of conservationists, educators, dedicated listers, casual birders, and everybody in\r\nbetween. Content ranges from serious to casual, humorous to harrowing, with fresh perspectives on world birding. Our\r\ngoal is to increase knowledge of the world’s avifauna, highlight hotspots, and most of all, inspire birders to head out:\r\nbirding and travelling. Or at least offer some birding stories to make it through a workday trapped behind a desk or on\r\nthe couch during a winter freeze.\r\n\r\nPlease join us, as we explore the world one bird at a time and thank you again for picking up the issue. In this issue,\r\narticles range from Jamaica through Texas and Borneo.\r\n\r\nAnd best of all, **it's all open and freely available right here**.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*Stephan Lorenz*\r\n\r\nP.S.
