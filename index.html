<p>Birding Travel aims to promote responsible travel and encourage birders to seek new opportunities either across
different continents or closer to home. We strongly favor sustainable ecotourism and will highlight working examples in
our pages whenever possible. As birders and travellers we can play an integral role in conserving habitats and
protecting birds around the globe.  </p>

<p>Articles will include a wide range of topics, but mainly revolve around birding travel experiences from afar and North
America. From basic site guides, personal travel essays, to species sketches, Birding Travel looks at birding
opportunities through the eyes of conservationists, educators, dedicated listers, casual birders, and everybody in
between. Content ranges from serious to casual, humorous to harrowing, with fresh perspectives on world birding. Our
goal is to increase knowledge of the world’s avifauna, highlight hotspots, and most of all, inspire birders to head out:
birding and travelling. Or at least offer some birding stories to make it through a workday trapped behind a desk or on
the couch during a winter freeze.</p>

<p>Please join us, as we explore the world one bird at a time and thank you again for picking up the issue. In this issue,
articles range from Jamaica through Texas and Borneo.</p>

<p>And best of all, <strong>it's all open and freely available right here</strong>.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><em>Stephan Lorenz</em></p>
